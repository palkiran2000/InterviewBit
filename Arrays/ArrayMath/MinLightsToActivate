/*There is a corridor in a Jail which is N units long. Given an array A of size N. The ith index of this array is 0 if the light at ith position is faulty otherwise it is 1.

All the lights are of specific power B which if is placed at position X, it can light the corridor from [ X-B+1, X+B-1].

Initially all lights are off.

Return the minimum number of lights to be turned ON to light the whole corridor or -1 if the whole corridor cannot be lighted.*/
